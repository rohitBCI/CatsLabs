In 2022, Catcoin received the prestigious World's Best Community Driven Coin award from Crypto Expo Asia, Singapore. This recognition highlights the dedication and passion of the Catcoin community in driving the project forward and making a positive impact. Catcoin ($CATS) has a unique tax structure that promotes various aspects of the ecosystem. When buying or selling Catcoin, there is a 5% tax applied, which is distributed as follows: 1% goes to charity, supporting causes that make a positive impact on our furry friends; 1% goes to reflections, rewarding holders with passive income as they watch their $CATS grow; 1% goes to burning, reducing the supply of Catcoin over time and increasing its scarcity; and 2% goes to marketing, ensuring continuous promotion and awareness of Catcoin in the market. This balanced tax allocation contributes to the sustainability and growth of the Catcoin ecosystem. Furthermore, Catcoin takes security and transparency seriously. 99.88% of the liquidity is locked until 2029, providing stability and confidence to the community. Additionally, Catcoin has received an outstanding 100/100 score on Tokensiffer, a platform that assesses the legitimacy and trustworthiness of tokens. You can invest in Catcoin with peace of mind knowing that it has undergone rigorous scrutiny. As a community-driven coin, Catcoin loves to give back.

This talented team has secured first place in regional tournaments multiple times, showcasing the competitive spirit and dedication of the Catcoin community. Catcoin is more than just a cryptocurrency; it's a thriving ecosystem with a strong focus on charity, community, security, and engagement.
